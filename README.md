# CRM Backend API

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) backend application with **JWT authentication** and **role-based access control**. The system provides secure CRUD functionality for managing clients, leads, invoices, payments, and users. Built using **NestJS** framework with **TypeScript**, **TypeORM** for database management, **PostgreSQL** as the primary database, **Redis** for caching and job queues, and **Docker** for containerization.

### Key Features

- **JWT Authentication** with bcrypt password hashing
- **Role-based Access Control** (Admin, Accountant, Sales)
- **Prometheus Metrics** and structured logging
- **Background Job Processing** with Bull/Redis
- **Comprehensive Testing** (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- **OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation**
- **Clean Architecture** (DDD implementation in leads module)
- **Request/Response Logging** with authentication context

## Setup Instructions

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install and run the application:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd crm-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create environment file**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

   ```env
   # Database Configuration
   POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   POSTGRES_PORT=5432
   POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
   POSTGRES_DB=postgres_db_name

   # Test Database Configuration
   TEST_POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
   TEST_POSTGRES_PORT=5433
   TEST_POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
   TEST_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_test_postgres_password
   TEST_POSTGRES_DB=postgres_test_db_name

   # Redis Configuration (for caching and job queues)
   REDIS_HOST=localhost
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

   # JWT Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

   # Application Environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000

   # CORS Configuration (optional)
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001

   # Email Configuration (for notifications)
   MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
   MAIL_PORT=2525
   MAIL_USER=your_mailtrap_user
   MAIL_PASS=your_mailtrap_password
   MAIL_FROM=noreply@crm-backend.com
   ```

4. **Start database services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start both the main PostgreSQL database (port 5432) and test PostgreSQL database (port 5433).

5. **Build the application**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Run database migrations**

   For main database:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:main
   ```

   For test database:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:test
   ```

   Or run migrations on both databases:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:both
   ```

7. **Seed databases (optional)**

   For main database:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

   For test database:

   ```bash
   npm run seed:test
   ```

   Or seed both databases:

   ```bash
   npm run seed:both
   ```

8. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   # Development mode with hot reload
   npm run start:dev

   # Production mode
   npm run start:prod
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
**API Documentation**: `http://localhost:3000/api` (Swagger/OpenAPI)
**Metrics**: `http://localhost:3000/metrics` (Prometheus format)

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: POST to `/auth/login` with email and password
2. **Token**: Receive JWT access token in response
3. **Authorization**: Include token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for protected endpoints

### Default Users (created by seeding)

```bash
# Admin User
Email: admin@example.com
Password: securePassword123
Role: admin (full access)

# Accountant User
Email: accountant@example.com
Password: securePassword123
Role: accountant (invoices, payments, clients)

# Sales User
Email: sales@example.com
Password: securePassword123
Role: sales (leads, clients)
```

### Role-Based Permissions

- **Admin**: Full access to all endpoints
- **Accountant**: Can manage invoices, invoice items, payments, and view clients
- **Sales**: Can manage leads and clients

### Using Authentication

#### cURL Example

```bash
# 1. Login to get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"securePassword123"}'

# 2. Use token in subsequent requests
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

#### Postman Collection

Import the provided Postman collection and environment files:

- **Collection**: `postman/CRM-Backend-API.postman_collection.json`
- **Environment**: `postman/CRM-Backend-Environment.postman_environment.json`

The collection includes:

- Pre-configured authentication requests for all roles
- Automatic token storage and usage
- Complete endpoint coverage with examples
- Role-based request organization
