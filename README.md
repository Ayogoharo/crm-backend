# CRM Backend API

## Overview

This is a simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) backend application. The system provides simple CRUD functionality for managing clients, leads, invoices, payments, and users with role-based access control. Built using **NestJS** framework with **TypeScript**, **TypeORM** for database management, **PostgreSQL** as the primary database, **Redis** for caching, and **Docker** for containerization. The application follows RESTful API principles, error handling, and database relations.
